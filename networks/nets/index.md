### IRC Networks

[Server lists](/networks/servers/index.html). If you know the name of the
network already and just want to find some servers on that network, skip
right to our server lists.

[Popular Nets](/networks/popular.html). Networks with over 10,000 users
maximum. Combined, they account for over 90% of IRC usage. Certainly the
place(s) to go to just hang around and browse. Being the size they are,
they tend to be plagued by lag, splits, spam and general stupidity much
more than smaller ones. Still, for most people, one of these is \'the
place to be\'.

[Medium-sized networks](medium.html). These are \'smaller networks\'
which have grown up. As a rule, they offer the same kind of service, but
tend to look a bit more like the major nets. Networks with a maximum
usercount of 1,000 to 20,000 are listed in this category.

[The smaller networks](small.html). Networks with under 1000 users
maximum. Frequently created as alternatives to the major nets, most of
these networks attempt to avoid those problems which make life tough on
the large nets. As a rule, they will promise either no lag, no splits,
no oper abuse, no porn, no warez, yes warez, general lawlessness or any
combination of the above. Some of them are also pretty successful and
certainly are viable alternatives to the Big Four.

[Subject and Special interest networks](/networks/nets/subject.html). As an
alternative to gathering on channels on one of the other smaller or
larger networks, some groups of people have set up their own networks,
dedicated to their cause, subject of interest or serving a particular
social group. Some are part of a larger internet presence regarding
their subject and may lead to much more information on it.

[Local networks](/networks/nets/local.html). Does it have to be \'global\'? The answer
is No! Local and national networks are becoming increasing popular, as
they allow local server connections, especially useful in areas with bad
network connectivity, offer an environment where the local language is
predominant in the case of non-English speaking countries and, of
course, will be a place for discussing topics of local interest. They
vary in size, having five to 100 client servers and 200 to over 5000
users at their peak, some having more users from their domain than are
on all other networks combined. A welcome option for both locals and
expatriates. Some of them also have a server or two outside their domain
to accommodate foreign clients.
