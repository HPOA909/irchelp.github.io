years.<br>

[WebNet](http://www.webchat.org/)<br>

[Server list](http://www.webchat.org/servers.html)

Starlink and Starlink-IRC are now in [small networks](small.html).

[MSN](http://communities.msn.com/people/)<br>
Microsoft\'s own chat system, based on something called the Microsoft
Exchange Chat Service. Formerly IRC- and web-based, as of May 2001, they
require you to use their web link, which will prompt you to download
their special client. Since you cannot connect to this network using a
standard IRC client, we will no longer provide information on it, beyond
simply pointing you to their own web site.

[Talk City](http://www.talkcity.com/)<br>
This is another large IRC/web-based chat network that has become
unreasonably restrictive. As of April 2000, TalkCity required the use of
specially modified versions of IRC clients such as mIRC for Windows,
Ircle for Mac, etc. This was ostensibly to prevent abuse from people who
were using customized \"war scripts\" to attack other users. Not
surprisingly, the modified clients also came with annoying streaming
ads, so you decide for yourself what their true intention was. Since
this network can no longer be reached using standard IRC clients, we
will no longer provide information on it, beyond simply pointing you to
their own web site.
