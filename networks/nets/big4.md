<p>All major networks are suffering from severe and often coordinated attacks from individuals and groups who evidently like to saw off the branch they're sitting on. This situation has led to stricter, sometimes even draconian abuse control and access policies on behalf of the networks' administration. Being on these networks is hardly fun these days, but they remain the most popular places to chat, <a href="../../security/warez.html">exchange files</a>, etc.

<p><h4><a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</a></h4>
Servers: ~40<br>
Locations: Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, UK, USA<br>
Max users: &gt;78,000<br>
Max channels: &gt;29,000<br>
Services: None except <a href="/ircd/chanfix">pseudo-chanserv</a><br>
<p>Formerly the prime IRC network and for a long time synonymous with IRC, EFnet is now sustained by its administration more than its users. EFnet stands for Eris-Free net, due to a historical event involving a server with a machine name of
'eris'. Following the July '96 seperation of what is now IRCnet, the userbase is
primarily North American. <a href="/networks/connectprob.html">Connecting to EFnet</a> can be a problem, as the servers' access
policies have become a lot stricter due to abuse problems that continue to threaten the network's existence. Note that EFnet and IRCnet both do not support any services such as channel or nickname registration.

<p><h4><a href="http://www.undernet.org/">Undernet</a></h4>
Servers: ~40<br>
Locations: Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK, USA<br>
Max users: &gt;87,000<br>
Max channels: &gt;35,000<br>
Services: Channel (X, W)<br>
<p>Law and order are said to prevail here, but of course that's not likely with that
many users and a minimal number of operators to keep abusers in check. The channel
service requires certain conditions before registering a channel. Policy and
application form are available from the web site. Support for its services via WWW and
FTP is extensive. This is a stable and highly organized network which has pioneered
features now commonplace on other networks.
<br>Note: After a 2 month hiatus, <a href="http://cservice.undernet.org/">services</a> have been restored as the network finally recovers from a series of denial of service attacks.

<p><h4><a href="http://www.ircnet.com/">IRCnet</a></h4>
Servers: &gt;120<br>
Locations: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Rep., Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Russia, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK, USA<br>
Max users: &gt;106,000<br>
Max channels: &gt;45,000<br>
Services: None<br>
<p>Originally a product of the July 1996 division of EFnet, IRCnet has outgrown itself to an unexpected point.
This network lays claim to the historical privilege of being the original IRC network. This is supported by the
fact that the core of early IRC, including the Finnish site where IRC was first used,
are now part of it. Administration and operation are also done in a much more
traditional manner than on other networks. Many of the most popular channels here are
"national" channels, devoted to the social gathering of nationals of a
variety of mainly European countries and regions. This is also the only network with a
strong Japanese presence.<br>
IRCnet is plagued by the activities of organized gangs of hooligans harassing users and channels with practical immunity. If you're a new user, you don't want to go there. Seriously. On the other hand, you don't really want to go to any of the other major networks either, with the possible exception of DALnet.

<p><h4><a href="http://www.dal.net/">DALnet</a></h4>
Servers: ~30<br>
Locations: Canada, Germany, Norway, Sweden, UK, USA<br>
Max users: &gt;106,000<br>
Max channels: &gt;39,000<br>
Services: Nickname (NickServ), channel (ChanServ), memo (MemoServ)<br>
<p>Originally created by users of EFnet's #startrek, it has long since outgrown that
to become one of the major networks on the IRC map. It owes much of its popularity to
easy registration of nicknames and channels. People with strong proprietary feelings
about names and those who lack the numbers or resources to support a channel on one of
the other networks more often than not end up here. Because of these services and a no-nonsense attitude taken by the admins to curb abuse, DALnet is often a good choice for people new to IRC. Unfortunately, certain ISPs with many new users happen to be banned as part of that plan to curb abuse.
<P>DALnet has been under sustained denial of service attacks for several months now. If you have trouble connecting, just keep trying the different servers in their list below.
