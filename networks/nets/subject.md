<h3 align="center">Subject and special interest networks</h3>
<hr>
<p>As an alternative to gathering on channels on one of the other smaller
or larger networks, some groups of people have set up their own networks,
dedicated to their cause or subject of interest. Here are some of them,
loosely grouped by subject. This section will also include single-server
outfits, since there are a number of standalone IRC servers which fall into
this category.
