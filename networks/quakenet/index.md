# QuakeNet

[QuakeNet](https://www.quakenet.org/) is a major IRC network with a strong focus on gaming. It was founded in 1997 by players of the popular first person shooter(FPS) game Quake, at a time when multiplayer "deathmatch" gameplay was in its infancy, and grew at a phenomenal rate, reaching an unprecedented peak of nearly 250000 users in 2005.

# Official Channels

According to <https://www.quakenet.org/help/general/what-are-the-official-channels>, QuakeNet has three official support channels.

- \#help is the official channel for questions related to IRC and QuakeNet.

- \#feds is a restricted channel. Users may be invited here from #help if they raise issues [requiring the assistance of IRC operators](https://www.quakenet.org/help/opers).

- \#help-script provides scripting assistance for mIRC.

# Services

Similar to Undernet, QuakeNet provides user identification and channel registration services via its ["Q" services](https://www.quakenet.org/help/q), but no nickname registration. Two additional services unique to QuakeNet are also available on request for registered channels, the ["D" service](https://www.quakenet.org/help/d) for channel statistics, and the ["S" service](https://www.quakenet.org/help/s) for spam detection.
