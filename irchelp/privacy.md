# IRChelp.org Privacy Notice, Mission Statement, and General Rant

This will be brief and free of legal jargon. We are just a group of volunteer
helpers. We have no commercial interests of any sort. None of us are paid or
gain anything by doing this. In fact, it's costing us money and time. We're
just here to help people because we enjoy it.

**We have a strict no-ad policy.** We do not want to sell you anything, period.
That means no banner ads, hot links, or pushy recommendations, PERIOD. IMHO,
ads represent conflicts of interest for a help site. Our reputation and Google
rank came from our content and nothing else. Thanks to like-minded
[organizations](/irchelp/credit.html) that don't mind donating free computing
power and bandwidth, we have been providing our free service with no strings
attached since 1994, and plan to continue doing so indefinitely.

**We have a strict privacy policy.** That means no spam, PERIOD. 
Our email question form `../mail.cgi` is the only one where we ask you to put
in your email address, otherwise how else would we answer your question? 
That information is not recorded, we hit reply to answer your question, then
your address is thrown away forever. So please feel free to use your "real"
address.  To help us help you better, the computer also records the IP number,
browser version, and operating system version. This is standard practice, and
none of this is linked to you personally. Any website you visit can see this
information, so it's really no big deal. We're not going to sell you anything.
We promise.

Like all responsible web sites, we do log all web hits - your IP, the date and
time, and the web page you visited. This is for our own debugging and
information only, such as to figure out what our most popular pages are so
that we can focus our efforts on keeping those up to date. In no way will your
IP or any other information be used for public or commercial purposes.

**If you have any questions or concerns** regarding our privacy policy or
general mission statement, feel free to email me using our [email question
form](../mail.cgi) - just select the webmaster, who is the last helper in the
popup list. Constructive criticism and feedback are always welcome.
