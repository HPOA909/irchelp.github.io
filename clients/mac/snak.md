This client is what I personally recommend to users who may be coming from a
Windows/mIRC background (welcome!) or who want a more serious IRC client with
all the latest bells and whistles, full support, etc.
Snak is the most rich in features and has been actively developed since the
1990s, with dozens of updates over the past few years while the traditional
gold standard Ircle has essentially stood still. Snak appeals to people who
prefer a streamlined interface without sacrificing all the "cool" features.
Everything for each channel is contained in one window, docking windows will in
fact allow multiple channels to share a window to maximize your precious screen
space.
The channel list feature is particularly fast and easy to use (unlike Ircle).
Very easy to set up and configure. Supports both the scripting language from
the classic [ircII](/irchelp/ircii/) client for \*nix (UNIX, Linux, etc.) shell
access acounts, so you can tap into the wealth of existing ircII scripts, as
well as Ircle-style Applescript scripts.
There are also automated responses to events so that you can set up script-like
actions without being a scripting expert.
For those who like such things, fully customizable appearance themes
are available.
Supports multiple connections, and for each connection, uses ircII-style server
lists which will automatically try the next server in a list until it succeeds
(Ircle only allows one server to be defined for each connection).
Guardian feature permits adult control, for what that's worth
(Ircle has none).
MP3 list feature facilitates downloads.
Excellent built-in help menu, balloon help, and bundled help manual (Ircle has
        none). $29 shareware (covering updates over 2 years) is a great value
and an example of how [shareware](/misc/shareware.html) really can work.
