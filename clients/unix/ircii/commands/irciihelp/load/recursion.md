```
Usage: LOAD recursion
  These are just a bunch of useful examples of recursive aliases.
  Stuff like.. 
    conbunch <server list>		Connect to several servers.
    squitbunch <server list>		Squit several servers.
    versbunch <server|user list>	check version for several servers
  and my favorite
    opalot <+/-> <nickname list>	Op or deop several people.
  
  There are more.. Take a look at the file and the format of how things
  are done.  And be sure to remember the MAX_RECURSIONS limit.
