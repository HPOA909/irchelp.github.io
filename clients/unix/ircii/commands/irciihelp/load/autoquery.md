```
Usage: LOAD autoquery
  The autoquery script sets up ircII to create a new window for
  each person you /MSG with.  It replaces all current /ON MSG
  and /ON SEND_MSG hooks, so be warned.

Additionnal commands available:
  talkto <nick>   Start a message window for <nick>
  reply [<nick>]  Start a message window for <nick>, or for the
		  last person a message was received from, if no
		  <nick> is specified.
```
