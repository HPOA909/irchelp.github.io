```
Usage: LOAD history
  Let's you use a few special escape sequences in a line.
    !$           expands to the last word in the previous line
    !0 !1 ... !9 expand to the first ten words in the last line entered
    !*           expands to all but the first word in the last line entered

  Use meta3-h to toggle function on and off..  ^K is bound to meta3
  in this script, thus  ^K-h will turn it on and off.
```
