```
Usage: FLUSH
  Flushes all pending output from the server.  This has the
  effect of stopping long lists from the server, such as a LINKS
  command which can get quite lengthy.  It also flushed any 
  output pending from the client itself.  It is useful for 
  wiping away anything pending when you have SET HOLD_MODE
  enabled.
