```
Usage: SET BEEP [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Turns ON or OFF the audibleness of ^G's when received.  If ON,
  ^Gs should beep the terminal.  When OFF, ^G's will be treated
  as other control characters and show up as G in the display.
  The setting of BEEP does not affect the beeps
  generated by the BEEP_ON_MSG variable and the BEEP_WHEN_AWAY
  variable.
