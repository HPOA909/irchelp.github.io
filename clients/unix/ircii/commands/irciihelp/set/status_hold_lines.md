```
Usage: SET STATUS_HOLD_LINES <text of message for status line>
  The value of STATUS_HOLD_MODE is replaced in the STATUS_FORMAT
  variable for any occurence of %B if the display is current on 
  hold.  This shows the number of lines currently being held in
  the buffer. If the display is not being held, it is replaced 
  with nothing.
