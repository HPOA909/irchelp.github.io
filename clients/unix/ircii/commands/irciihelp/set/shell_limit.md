```
Usage: SET SHELL_LIMIT <value>
  Sets the maximum number of lines of output from any EXEC'd
  process.  This is useful to prevent yourself from accidentally
  starting a process with EXEC that spits out soooo much output
  that everything you know and love grinds to a halt.  Setting
  it to 0 puts no limit on the number of output lines from a
  process.
