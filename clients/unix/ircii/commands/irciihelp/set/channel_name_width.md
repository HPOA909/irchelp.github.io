```
Usage: SET CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH <value>
  Lets you adjust the amount of space used to display channel
  names in the LIST and NAMES output and in the status line of
  IRCII.  If CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH is set to 0, no channel width
  formatting is performed and channel names are displayed at
  full width.
