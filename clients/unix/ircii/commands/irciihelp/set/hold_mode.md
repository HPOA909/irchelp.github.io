```
Usage: SET HOLD_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When ON, IRCII will pause at the end of each page of output.
  Output will continue when the TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN function is
  activated (bound, by default, to ctrl-S) or when the
  SEND_LINE function is activated (bound, by default, to the
  Return or Enter key).

Note:
  If using multiple windows the HOLD_MODE value refers to
  default setting for new windows.   To effect the hold mode
  of individual windows refer to WINDOW HOLD_MODE

```
