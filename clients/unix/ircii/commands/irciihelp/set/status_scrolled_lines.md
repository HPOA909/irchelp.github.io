```
Usage: SET STATUS_SCROLLED_LINES <text of message for status line>
  The value of STATUS_SCROLLED_MODE is replaced in the STATUS_FORMAT
  variable for any occurence of %s if the display is current on 
  hold.  This shows the number of lines currently scrolled up in
  the buffer. If the display is not being scrolled, it is replaced 
  with nothing.
