Usage: SET EIGHT_BIT_CHARACTERS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Allows you, if set, to input 8 bit characters.
  (such as the Swedish character set)

Notes:
  On SUN machines, you will have to use `stty pass8' and not
  `stty cs8' to be able to use this properly.

  By default, M-b M-d M-f M-h and M-^? (del) are bound to the 
  corresponding emacs keys.
