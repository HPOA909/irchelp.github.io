```
Usage: SET INPUT_PROTECTION [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When set this variable will prevent you from using the ON INPUT
  functionality.  ON INPUT is extremely dangerous in that it can
  easily disable or throw the client into a loop.  Be sure you
  know what you're doing if you decide to use this function.
