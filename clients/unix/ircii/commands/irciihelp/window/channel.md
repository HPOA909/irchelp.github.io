Usage: WINDOW CHANNEL <c[,<k>]>  
  Directs all conversation with channel <c> to the current window. 
  If you are not current on channel <c>, you will join it. If you 
  are on channel <c> it will be diverted to the current window, 
  possibly removing channel <c> from another window.  If you specify
  <k> it will be used as the channel key to join channel <c>.
