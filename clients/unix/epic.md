# EPIC

[EPIC](http://www.epicsol.org) was originally forked from 
[ircII](/clients/unix/ircii) 
2.8.2, and emerged at a time when ircII
development was extremely stagnant. ircII's developer at the time was extremely
conservative, with a narrow vision of what an IRC client should and shouldn't be
and while many regarded 2.8.2 as the "perfect" ircII release, there were also
people bumping their heads against the artificial limitations imposed by the ircII
client and its scripting language. This, EPIC was born as a fork, and continues to
this day.

At the surface, remains extremely close to ircII 2.8.2, with an interface that is
nearly identical to that of ircII. This makes EPIC something of a clean slate -
just as with ircII you will have difficulty using it for more than a single
channel out of the box.

While there are some niceties like mIRC compatible colors, EPIC differentiates
from ircII in its scripting capabilities - EPIC development has been primarily
directed by the needs of script authors for over 20 years.
