### Mitnick tells IT managers to trust no one

The famous hacker says everyone in a business from CEO to receptionist must be
wise to the ways of computer system infiltrators.

**LOS ANGELES -- Infamous hacker Kevin Mitnick warned IT managers
Wednesday that unless they educate every employee -- from the CEO to the
receptionist -- about how hackers work and how to bolster security,
corporate networks and Web sites will never be safe from attack.**


In the closing keynote speech here at Giga Information Group's
Infrastructures for E-Business conference -- his first such speech since
being released from prison in January -- Mitnick described the mindset,
objectives and methods hackers use to compromise corporate computer
networks. He said the key to security is detection and reaction.

"You should adopt the mantra 'In God we trust. Everybody else is
suspect,'" he said. "People are the weakest link when it comes to
security, and an important question to ask yourself is not if, but when,
is your e-business going to be targeted?"

Mitnick was convicted on five federal counts of wiretapping and computer
fraud and was released from prison after serving a five-year sentence.
He was accused of causing millions of dollars in damages by hacking into
the computer systems of Fujitsu, Motorola, Nokia and the University of
California. He is is currently serving a three-year probation, during
which he is required to obtain special permission to use a computer.

#### What to be on the lookout for
With the proliferation of e-commerce, Mitnick said, every employee must
be aware of techniques and ruses used by attackers to gain control of
internal computers. Technology, he said, isn't enough. Employees at all
levels must know how to choose good passwords and write policies and
procedures to protect the enterprise from viruses, worms and Trojan
horses.

"It's na√Øve to assume that just installing a firewall is going to
protect you from all potential security threat," he said. "That
assumption creates a false sense of security, and having a false sense
of security is worse than having no security at all."

Mitnick also gave IT managers insights into the physical methods
attackers use to gain access to vulnerable network access points. He
warned against keeping certain rooms unlocked when not in use, such as
conference rooms with data jacks, computer training rooms and telephone
and cable closets. And he advised organizations to classify sensitive
and confidential information and erase or destroy data on all discarded
magnetic media in order to dissuade dumpster diving, a favorite hacker
trick used to obtain password lists and corporate directory information.

Mitnick recommended that businesses analyze the costs and benefits of
security risk reduction as they would any other part of their business.
He recommended that organizations do risk assessments to determine
threat impact and expected loss per incident, to balance cost with risk
reduction and to keep current on security vulnerabilities.

Mitnick concluded by advising IT managers to motivate every person in
the organization to see the benefits of security. Without the help of
everyone, all the technology in the world can't keep a computer network
safe, he said.

"In today's world, there's no way to eliminate the total threat because
there will always be people who can get behind the walls," Mitnick said.
"But people are the weakest link. Make sure they understand security is
a dynamic process."
