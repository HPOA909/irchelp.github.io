The dmsetup2.exe Trojan horse attack

7/16/98

We'll cut to the chase and tell you how to fix it, if you're pretty sure
you have this bug. See the main help page for more info about trojan
horse attacks in general and other trojans in particular:

Find out the name of the file that is sending, there are many names to
dmsetup2 and the file size is usually around 81084 bytes

Once you have the filename, do the following:

Step 1. Type /remote off
Step 2. Type /unload -rs filename.INI (make sure you drop the .exe and use .ini)
Step 3. Type /remove filename.ini (see above)
Step 4. Type //say $findfile(c:\,filename,0)
Step 5. Type //remove $findfile(c:\,filename,1)
Repeat Step 5 for as many copies of the virus as there are...
For example if step 4 returned a result of "7" then you will need to do
step 5 7 times. 
Step 6. //say $findfile(c:\,filename,0)
If result is 0 then go to step 7, else repeat step 5 again until result 
for step 6 is 0
Step 7. //say $lines(c:\autoexec.bat)
Step 8. //say $read -ln c:\autoexec.bat
Where n is the number returned by Step 7
If Step 8 returns "Filename -inauto"
then do //write -dn c:\autoexec.bat
else get the person to open there autoexec.bat file (/run notepad 
c:\autoexec.bat) and find the line with there filename -inauto and 
remove the line completely. then save and exit notepad
Step 9. type /remove c:\ni.cfg
Step 10. type /remove mIRC.ini
Step 11. type /remove bakupwrks.ini
Step 12. Close mIRC and REBOOT your computer
Step 13. Come back to mIRC and type //say $exists(c:\ni.cfg)
Step 14. If this returns $False then you are cleared, type /remote on
and /sreq ask. Do not download files you are unsure of especially .exe 
and .ini files
otherwise the file hasn't been removed, seek assistance from someone in
a recognised help channel.

If you have two folders left over in the mirc download dir called
ÿdm2yif and suckÿit Type

//run command /c deltree c:\ $+ [ $chr(255) $+ dm2yif ] and /c deltree c:\ $+ [ suck $+ $chr(255) $+ it ]

that should delete them.

If the title bar says "your mirc is buggy" you can change this by typing //titlebar [new title]
