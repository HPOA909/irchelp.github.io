        <p>Internet Users Swap News, Worries After Quake Hits<br>
          Associated Press - San Francisco</p>
        <p>Faster than a 9600 baud modem, the global computer network buzzed into 
          action after the ground stopped shaking Monday in Southern California. 
          And the system held up, even though the quake knocked out at least one 
          main link.</p>
        <p>Within 20 minutes of the predawn earthquake, electronic messages flew 
          on the Internet as computer users in the quake area described the destruction 
          and people elsewhere asked about the fate of loved ones.</p>
        <p>One man typed simply: "It was a hell of a ride."</p>
        <p>A plea from Tobias Koehler in Denmark went out shortly after the quake 
          hit. "Hi there. Is everything OK in Ventura, California? My sister just 
          went there for the first time." </p>
        <p>In an electronic version of a ham radio network, some computer users 
          in various parts of the country offered to relay messages to people 
          in their areas from relatives and friends who couldn't make long-distance 
          phone calls from the quake zone.</p>
        <p>Computer users connect to the Internet at universities or their jobs 
          or by subscribing to one of a growing number of commercial services 
          that give access to the network. Users can send electronic mail - e-mail 
          - back and forth or "chat" with large numbers of users at one time.</p>
        <p>As many as 50 people at a time were logged into an International Relay 
          Chat channel "Earthquake," set up by a user less than an hour after 
          the bolt. It works like a party line, with each participant's comments 
          scrolling down the screen, like the lines of a play.</p>
        <p>One man logged on using the nickname "KNBC" and relayed details of 
          television converage from the NBC-TV affiliate in Los Angeles. Another 
          provided radio reports. Others in Los Angeles simply described what 
          they saw themselves. A sampler:</p>
        <p>* "5 confirmed deaths, 4 heart attacks and 1 motorcycycle cop."<br>
          * "Special envoy (head of FEMA) heading to LA - held up by winter weather 
          in DC."<br>
          * "Studio City - dude's car is holding onto the driveway by the back 
          tires. The Mercedes looks like it's in good condition, but it's prepped 
          for a ride down the hill."</p>
        <p>The "Earthquake" channel quickly became the designated news channel. 
          A secondary chat was set up, called "Quakechat," for people to discuss 
          what was happening.</p>
        <p>Some Internet users set up a news group - a semipermanent bulletin 
          board for news items, comments and firsthand accounts - within 20 minutes 
          of the quake.</p>
        <p>The Internet originally was built in the 1970s as a military communications 
          network that could survive a nuclear attack. It worked well Monday, 
          even though a major node, or switching point, at UCLA was knocked out, 
          as were nodes at several other universities in the area. The network 
          automatically reroutes messages to minimize the effect of damages to 
          any individual node.</p>
        <p>One commercial computer bulletin-board service, Prodigy, set up a free 
          bulletin board called "LA EARTHQUAKE" and reported that 500 messages 
          were posted on it within the first few hours. Prodigy created a similar 
          bulletin board after the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Computer users with Internet access can connect to the International 
          Relay Chat by loggin on to the network and typing "IRC" and then "earthquake" 
          or "quakechat" (without the quotation marks_. The address for the earthquake 
          news group is "alt.current-events.la-quake" (again, without the quotation 
          marks).</p>
