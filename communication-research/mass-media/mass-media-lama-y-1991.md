        <p>By Yanji Lama</p>
        <p>As the world anxiously awaited word from Israel after Iraqi missiles 
          struck last Thursday, an international computer network allowed Israeli 
          users in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa - and students in Ann Arbor 
          - to communicate throughout the attack. Through Internet Relay Chat 
          (IRC) - a special network that allows users to converse by being channel 
          through servers located around the world - international events are 
          being transmitted faster than network news and radio. Computer Engineering 
          senior Mike Pelletier, a regional IRC server operator, said over 300 
          users were on-line during the attack - almost double the usual number 
          of users on line at any given time. Pelletier said IRC was the only 
          information source in Europe for four hours after the March 17 bombing 
          of Israel by Iraq. International users relayed information they heard 
          from local media while Israelis described what they were experiencing 
          first-hand. </p>
        <p>Pelletier said users in Israel remained on-line while donning gas masks, 
          telling of air raid sirens, local news reports, and their growing apprehension. 
          Many had terminals in their sealed rooms and continued typing throughout 
          the crisis. One user in Haifa under the name "Nati" typed "I'm shaking" 
          during the bombardment.</p>
        <p>For Pelletier, being on-line with users all over the world, especially 
          those in Israel during the bombing, was an experience that made the 
          war even more personal. "I'm worried about Nati in Haifa," he said. 
          Pelletier has not heard from Nati on IRC since the bombing. [I did over 
          the weekend, however.] Even though several University students and Ann 
          Arbor residents use IRC, Pelletier said he is surprised it isn't more 
          popular.</p>
        <p>Pelletier described IRC as "truly the global village." Developed four 
          years ago in Finland by Jarkko Oikarinen, IRC is a quicker alternative 
          to the "talk" utility available on most UNIX systems. To connect with 
          IRC, type in "irc" at a shell prompt of any CAEN (Computer Aided Engineering 
          Network) supported UNIX machine. IRC conversations during the January 
          16 bombing of Baghdad and the March 17 [sic] bombing of Israel are stored 
          an [sic] IRC log. More information about IRC can be obtained at the 
          User Services Office at 231 Chrysler on North Campus.</p>
