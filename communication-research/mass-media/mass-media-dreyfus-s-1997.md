        <h3>How Internet chat shrinks the world </h3>
        <p>By S.M. DREYFUS </p>
        <p>COMPUTER programmer Matthew Green wasn't looking for love when he began 
          spending hours using Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Like many other users 
          of the Internet's live, multi-user chatting service, he was a student, 
          with time on his hands, a desire to travel and not much money. He couldn't 
          afford to tour Europe, the US and Canada in person, so he visited them 
          electronically, via the IRC. </p>
        <p>Thousands of hours on-line and millions of keystrokes later, he fell 
          in love with an American student, Monica Weaver, in 1992. Two-and-a-half 
          years after that, he flew to Illinios to meet her in person. In mid-1995, 
          she moved to Australia and they were married. </p>
        <p>Interestingly, Green played a pivotal role in developing the very network 
          that allowed him to meet his spouse. Now working as a systems administrator 
          with the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute in Melbourne, 
          Green was maintaining and developing IRC II, the most widely used UNIX 
          IRC client software. </p>
        <p>He is one of two Australians who fundamentally shaped the worldwide 
          IRC network. The second, Internet security analyst Darren Reed, of Cybersource 
          Pty Ltd, maintains and develops IRCD, the software used by the hundreds 
          of connected Unix servers that form the backbones of the IRC networks. 
        </p>
        <p>Reed also essentially set the standards for IRC communications, having 
          co-authored the IRC technical standard, or RFC. An RFC, or Request for 
          Comments, is basically how a technical standard is defined for an Internet 
          protocol and is a mark of prestige in the coding world. </p>
        <p>Both Green and Reed view IRC primarily as a playground - a fun way 
          to spend leisure time and learn about other cultures. Green said: &quot;It 
          is a very time-efficient way of meeting people with similar interests.&quot; 
          However, companies are increasingly using IRC in their intranets for 
          work, not play. </p>
        <p>Long-time IRC user Matthew Aldous, a systems administrator at the Mental 
          Health Research Institute, said: &quot;IRC is used as a cheap, fast, 
          text-based alternative to collaborative discussion.&quot; He estimated 
          that, outside intranet use, about 5 per cent of today's IRC traffic 
          was work related, with another 10 per cent being related to education. 
          The last 85 percent was still little more than friendly banter. </p>
        <p>According to Reed, the number of non-concurrent IRC users has grown 
          dramatically from 2000 worldwide in 1990 to what is believed to be at 
          least half a million people today, excluding corporate intranets. American 
          internet service providers (ISPs) estimated that about a third of their 
          customers wanted IRC - and asked for it by name, he said. </p>
        <p>The importance of this growth is evidenced by the big companies' increasing 
          interest in IRC. Netscape is trialling a new IRC chat program (Netscape 
          Chat 2.0 beta) and Microsoft is believed to be planning to swap from 
          its own proprietary protocol in its chat program to the standard communications 
          protocol used in most IRC client software. </p>
        <p>Green believes that Australia has an unusually high number of IRC users 
          and puts this down to the country's physical isolation. &quot;The more 
          remote people are, the more likely they are to use IRC,&quot; said Reed. 
          As it has grown, the world's largest electronic playground has changed 
          and fragmented. IRC was once a large, interconnected network with a 
          few hundred &quot;channels&quot; dedicated to specific topics. You could 
          join a channel, such as #cricket, #france, #linux, or #hottub, the original 
          sex channel, to catch up with the same people virtually every day. You 
          could develop a community of online friends. </p>
        <p>In mid-1996, many users who had joined a channel regularly found the 
          place empty. All their on-line friends, and perhaps even electronic 
          lovers, had disappeared. The main, unified IRC network had been ripped 
          apart. </p>
        <p>The primary cause was a political bun fight between American and European 
          server operators, according to Green, who spent a great deal of time 
          on-line listening to the people trying to negotiate the network back 
          together. He said the Americans expelled one of their own operators, 
          for allegedly hacking his IRC server, behaving like a cowboy and causing 
          general pandemonium on the network. </p>
        <p>The cowboy's expulsion from the IRC network might have gone largely 
          unnoticed except for one key fact: the network's main link between Europe 
          and the US just happened to run through the cowboy's server. So, when 
          the American operators cut him off, they also cut off all of Europe. 
          Australia was caught in the cross fire. </p>
        <p>While the European operators didn't condone the cowboy's behavior, 
          they thought the expulsion was an over-reaction. There had always been 
          differences in how the Americans and Europeans did things and the dispute 
          highlighted those differences, but neither side was prepared for the 
          backlash from the IRC users. </p>
        <p>&quot;I saw a lot of users get very angry at both sides because the 
          friends they had been talking to just weren't there any more,&quot; 
          Green said. &quot;People joined the operators' channels and abused them. 
          Thousands of people complained.&quot; </p>
        <p>Several weeks of frantic e-mail and high-level negotiations, culminating 
          in an on-line conference of more than 50 senior IRC operators and developers, 
          failed to heal the rift. The schism became permanent. The two halves 
          evolved into what are known today as Efnet and Irc Net. The third network, 
          Undernet, began a few years before but was never a part of the main 
          unified IRC network. </p>
        <p>New small networks started springing up. There are now at least 45 
          different IRC networks, none of which talk to each other. Some are local 
          networks, some are international. </p>
        <p>According to Reed, commercialisation of the Internet in Australia also 
          contributed to the growth of smaller local IRC networks and therefore 
          the fragmentation of IRC worldwide. </p>
        <p>&quot;Australia was cut off from the larger IRC networks for a period 
          because of volume charging and the ever-increasing levels of IRC traffic,&quot; 
          Reed said. </p>
        <p>He explained that most IRC servers in Australia were originally volunteer 
          outfits, with people such as himself and Green donating their time and 
          universities provided a computer link. But when the Internet was commercialised 
          and Telstra began volume charging for international Internet traffic, 
          the universities re-evaluated some Internet services. </p>
        <p>A few local Australian IRC networks appeared in response, but without 
          international links. The situation improved recently when Telstra began 
          running its own IRC server, which provides access to international IRC 
          channels. But finding a channel you can call home on-line - and keeping 
          it - is more difficult. Green concedes that IRC is not stable. But there 
          is greater choice now on IRC, with thousands of IRC channels. In theory, 
          there is also less &quot;lag&quot; - delay in sending messages. </p>
        <p>Matthew Aldous said the break-up of IRC was inevitable due to its rapid 
          growth. The original, underlying communications protocol simply wasn't 
          designed for so much traffic. </p>
        <p>&quot;The protocol started saturating. Maybe the split-up kept IRC 
          alive,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, if you tried to put all the IRC networks 
          together again, it just wouldn't work. It would be like 50,000 drivers 
          hitting the freeway at the same time - no one would go anywhere.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>But while the network has been breaking up, its users continue to come 
          together. Green has just attended yet another wedding, this time in 
          Sydney, of an IRC couple. </p>
        <p>That is the upside. The downside is that there are many people who 
          have been deeply disappointed after meeting an IRC friend in person. 
          Green warns people not to expect too much from IRC. &quot;Just because 
          I met my wife on IRC, doesn't mean you will,&quot; he said. </p>
        <p>Like most forms of recreation, using IRC carries some other risks. 
          Addiction is endemic among IRC users. According to Reed, those with 
          plenty of spare time, such as students or people in undemanding jobs, 
          often spend 40 hours a week on IRC. In fact, IRC is known at some universities 
          as &quot;I Repeat Classes&quot;. </p>
        <p>Aldous warns people that nothing a user says on IRC should be considered 
          private, even if it is sent in a private message. He said: &quot;You 
          have to remind yourself when you are on, chatting on IRC, that everything 
          you say is just as private as if you stood on the steps of Flinders 
          Street Station and shouted it at the top of your lungs.&quot; </p>
        <p>As IRC has grown, so have the number of &quot;undesirable&quot; people 
          who spend time on it. There have been stories of paedophiles convincing 
          children to give out their addresses over IRC, of infatuated men and 
          women endlessly harassing someone they met on IRC. One story has a woman 
          in the US being murdered by a man she met on IRC. </p>
        <p>Whether the stories are true or IRC folklore, the bottom line, according 
          to Reed, is that users should never give out personal details over the 
          IRC. </p>
        <p>Meeting IRC people in person can be a dangerous proposition. Then again, 
          living a little dangerously has its rewards - just ask Matthew and Monica 
          Green. </p>
