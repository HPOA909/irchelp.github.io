        <p>Here's a humourous account of IRC as the Ultimate MUD - Found on FonBot 
          on #penpals:</p>

          I've been folowing this newsgroup for a while and have read about 'IRC' 
          in the Online<br>
          Magazine. Is this a Virtual Reality game?</p>
        <p>Dude! You know it! It is the MOST excellent VR game there is... you 
          cruise around this maze and go into rooms (called channels). Each channel 
          has its own group of enemies that could be computer simulated people 
          (called bots) or actual other IRC players. Some of the players are armed 
          with mighty weapons (called ops) and can kill you, but through the help 
          of treasures you find (for example, "netsplits" or "Gargoyle") you can 
          kill them, or get an op for yourself. Once armed with an op, you can 
          kill all the enemies in the room, then lock up all the doors so no one 
          else can get in. There are an endless number of channels, so the fun 
          never ends.</p>
        <p>Most of the computer players are not incredibly lifelike, but they 
          are mean fighters unless you know the secret ways to kill them easily. 
          You can also talk to the other IRC players, but this is rarely done, 
          since it takes time away from the fighting and takeovers. Whatever it 
          is, it sounds like it's a really fun program (Although very technical--only 
          a few gods know about the commands and so forth).</p>
        <p>It's a lot of fun, and there is a lot of learning to be done. Woe to 
          the poor newbie who stumbles upon an experienced player armed with the 
          dreaded flash bomb, or even worse, a high-ranking member of the IRC 
          royalty carrying an "O-line," who can kill you where you stand for no 
          reason whatsoever. O-lines are the most feared and highly sought after 
          weapon in the IRC game. One can only be obtained through a series of 
          tortuous tasks colloquially known as "getting links"... or if one is 
          fortunate enough to stumble across the mighty wizard "dog3", and manages 
          to perform the sacred "netsex" ritual with him, an O-line is often granted.
