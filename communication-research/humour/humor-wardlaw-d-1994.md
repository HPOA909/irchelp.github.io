        <p><b>Wardlaw, Darren. &quot;IRC Romance.&quot; 2 July 1994.</b></p>
        <p>By Darren Wardlaw "DazzWa"</p>
        <p>Here's a poem I put together sometime last year... it is *not* my true 
          feelings towards IRC...</p>
        <p><b><i>"IRC Romance"</i></b></p>
        <p>Bleeding hearts stare out<br>
          Of busy computer screens<br>
          Old men and lonely women<br>
          Chatting to youthful teens</p>
        <p>Hey, are you m or f?<br>
          And where are you at?<br>
          Doesn't matter what colour you are<br>
          Or if you are old and fat</p>
        <p>True appearances are distorted<br>
          Conjured up by wishful minds<br>
          A skillful writer can always charm<br>
          Even the least-gullible kinds</p>
        <p>It all begins with innocent chatter<br>
          Then progresses to a *kiss* or a *hug*<br>
          Go on, say that you love them<br>
          Give their heart strings another tug</p>
        <p>The hours rapidly fly by<br>
          A mouth as dry as a bone<br>
          Netsplit, Operation would block<br>
          Leaves you all alone</p>
        <p>At the end of the day<br>
          Achievement has been much<br>
          Got a new sweetie from Finland<br>
          Learned how to say 'I love you' in Dutch</p>
        <p>As the screen goes blank<br>
          Wonders if tomorrow will bring such luck<br>
          Returning to a life of reality<br>
          Realizing how much real life does suck</p>
