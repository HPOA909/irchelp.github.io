        <p>Halfway on the Net<br>
          Is a channel<br>
          Where I sit.<br>
          There isn't any <br>
          Other channel<br>
          Quite like<br>
          It.<br>
          It's not in the bottom 'sphere,<br>
          And it's not in the top;<br>
          It lives in the server<br>
          Where<br>
          I always<br>
          +Op.</p>
        <p>Halfway on the Net<br>
          Isn't #talk,<br>
          And isn't #friends.<br>
          It isn't in the #twilight_zone,<br>
          It isn't the #hot_tub.<br>
          And all sorts of funny /topics<br>
          Run 'round my screen:<br>
          "It isn't really<br>
          Anywhere!<br>
          It's #penpals<br>
          Instead!"</p>
