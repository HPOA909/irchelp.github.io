        <p>The Tao of Internet Relay Chat<br>

        <p>---</p>
        <p> Something is formed by the electrons, born in the silent cable. Shaping<br>
          and growing and ungrowing. It is there yet not there. It is the source 
          of<br>
          Internet Relay Chat. I do not know the name, thus I will call it the 
          Tao<br>
          of Internet Relay Chat.</p>
        <p>If the Tao is great, then the IRC is running ceaselessly. If the IRC 
          is<br>
          great then the server is running without ever stoping. If the server 
          is<br>
          great then the client will always be the server. The luser is then pleased<br>
          and there is Chat in the world.</p>
        <p>The Tao of IRC squits far away and connects on returning.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The genetic potential of birth, a lot to know, yet unknown.<br>
          In the begining there was nothing.<br>
          Out of nothing the Tao gave birth to tolsun.oulu.fi. tolsun gave birth 
          to<br>
          OuluBox.</p>
        <p>OuluBox gave birth to rmsg.<br>
          rmsg was not Tao, so MUT gave birth to IRC.<br>
          No one knows when IRC came into existance, the mighty master WiZ have 
          it<br>
          to be at the end of the eight month in the year of the Dragon.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>Each channel has its purpose, however humble. Each channel is the Yin 
          and<br>
          Yang of IRC. Each channels has it's place within the IRC.</p>
        <p>In the beginning there was only channel 0, thus channel 0 is the soil 
          of IRC.</p>
        <p>Channel 1 to channel 10 then was open as the sea. Channel 11 to 999 
          was the<br>
          trees and forests of IRC. Channels above 999 should not be mentioned, 
          and<br>
          channels below 0 were unborn and contained many secrets.</p>
        <p>This was not the right Tao, so IRC gave birth to +channels.<br>
          +channels had the yin and yang. Mode does not.</p>
        <p>This was not the right Tao still, so IRC gave birth to #channels.<br>
          #channels have the yin and yang.</p>
        <p>Only channel 0 is the right path to Tao, but avoid speaking on channel 
          0.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>There was a great dispute among the BRoom-Walkers of the Relay. Some 
          of them<br>
          wanted neither yin nor yang. Out of this Eris came into existance. Some 
          of the<br>
          BRoom-Walkers then created Eris Free-net.</p>
        <p>This was the right Tao.</p>
        <p>Kind Gentle and Boring Net was another wrong path to the Tao of Internet 
          Relay Chat.</p>
        <p>Some time later there was a quantity of some lusers who wanted to be<br>
          BRoom-Walkers also. The Eris Free BRoom-Walkers did not agree with them,<br>
          thus a new IRC was born. This IRC is called the Undernet.</p>
        <p>But this is not the right Tao, either.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>There will always be disputes among the BRoom-Walkers of Internet Relay 
          Chat.</p>
        <p>This is the very nature of the IRC.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>Lusers that do not understand the Tao is always using the yang of Mode 
          on<br>
          their channels. Lusers that do understand the Tao are always using Ignore<br>
          on their channels.</p>
        <p>How could this not be so ?</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The wise sage luser is told about the Chat and uses it. The luser is 
          told<br>
          about the IRC and is looking for it. The flock are told about the Tao 
          and<br>
          make a fool of the IRC.</p>
        <p>If there was no laughter, there would be no Tao.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The master says:<br>
          "Without the Tao of Internet Relay Chat, life becomes meaningless."</p>
        <p>The Relay of the old time was mysterious and sacred. We can neither 
          imagine<br>
          its thoughts nor path; we are left but to describe.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The sage luser must be aware like a frog crossing the highway.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The great master Wumpus once dreamed that he was an automaton. When 
          he awoke<br>
          he exclaimed:<br>
          "I don't know whether I am Wumpus dreaming that I am a client,<br>
          or a client dreaming that I am Wumpus!"</p>
        <p>So was the first Automata born.</p>
        <p>The master Nap then said:<br>
          "Any automata should not speak unless spoken to.<br>
          Any automata shall only whisper when spoken to."</p>
        <p>Thus replied the master Gnarfer: bad. Create good automata, and the 
          IRC will hail you and you will<br>
          gain fame and fortune. Create bad automata and people will start to<br>
          hate you, and finaly you will be /KILLed to ethernal damnation"</p>
        <p>Many lusers have fallen into the clutches of ethernal damnation. They 
          were<br>
          not following the Tao.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>There once was a luser who went to #BotSex. Each day he saw the automatons.<br>
          The luser decided that he also would have such a automata.<br>
          He asked another luser for his automata. The other luser gave his automata<br>
          away.</p>
        <p>The luser was not within the Tao, so he just started the automata. 
          The automata<br>
          had only Yang inside so all the lusers files where deleted.</p>
        <p>Some moons laither the same luser then had become a sage luser, and 
          did create<br>
          his automata from the very grounds with materials found inside the IRC.<br>
          The luser was now within the Tao and his automata lived happily ever 
          after.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>There once was a master who wrote automatons without the help of master 
          Phone.<br>
          A novice luser, seeking to imitate him, began with the help of master 
          Phone.<br>
          When the novice luser asked the master to evaluate his automata the 
          master<br>
          replied: "What is a working automata for the master is not for the luser.<br>
          You must must BE the IRC before automating."</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>Master BigCheese gave birth to master Troy; his duty clear. Master 
          Troy gave<br>
          birth to master Phone, for the Tao of Irc must be eternal and must flow 
          as the<br>
          ceaseless river of Time itself.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>Master Phone once said about the ircII client:<br>
          "public_msg is for a message from someone NOT on the channel<br>
          public_other is for a message on a channel that doesn't belong to<br>
          a window. public is for a message on a channel that belongs to a<br>
          window!"</p>
        <p>Out of this raised the mighty chaos.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The sage luser came to the master who wrote automata without the help 
          of<br>
          master Phone. The sage luser asked the master who wrote automata: "Which 
          is<br>
          easiest to make. A automata with the help of master Phone or an automata<br>
          made with the help of a language ?"</p>
        <p>The master who wrote automata then replied:<br>
          "With the help of a language."</p>
        <p>The sage luser was disapointed and exclaimed: "But, with master Phone 
          you<br>
          do not need to know anything about the soil of IRC. Is not that the 
          easiet<br>
          way ?"</p>
        <p>"Not really" said the master who wrote automata, "when using master 
          Phone<br>
          you are closed inside a box. For sure, it is a great box for the lusers,<br>
          but the master will need more power, thus a language is the only path 
          to go.<br>
          With the language the master will never have to limit himself. When 
          using<br>
          such a language the master will seek the best between the need and the<br>
          availibility."</p>
        <p>"I see", said the sage luser.</p>
        <p>This is the essence of Tao of IRC automatas.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>A client should be light and be used for communication. The spirit 
          of a good<br>
          client is that it should be very convinient for the luser to use, but 
          hard<br>
          for the luser who want to create automata.<br>
          There should never ever be too many functions or too few functions.</p>
        <p>There should always be a ignore.</p>
        <p>Without ignore the client is not within the Tao of Chating.</p>
        <p>The client should always respond the luser with messages that will 
          not<br>
          astnonish him too much. The server likewise. If the server does not, 
          then it<br>
          is the clients job to explain what the server says.</p>
        <p>A client which fails this, will be useless and cause confusion for 
          the lusers.<br>
          The only way to correct this is to use another client or to write a 
          new one.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>A luser asked the masters on #IrcHelp: "My client does not work".<br>
          The masters replied: "Upgrade your client".<br>
          The luser then wondered why the master knew. The master then told him 
          about<br>
          the Protocol.</p>
        <p>"Your client does not work beaucse it does not understand the server. 
          Why<br>
          should it always work ? Only a fool would expect such. But, clients 
          are made<br>
          by humans, and humans are not perfect. Only Tao is.</p>
        <p>The IRC is solid. The IRC is floating, and will always be dynamic. 
          Live with<br>
          that or /quit."</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The luser came to the masters of #IrcHelp, asking about the Tao of 
          IRC within<br>
          the client.<br>
          The masters then said that the Tao of IRC always lies inside the client<br>
          regardless of how the client connects to the server.</p>
        <p>"Is the Tao in irc ?" asked the luser.<br>
          "It so is" replied the masters of #IrcHelp.<br>
          "Is the Tao in the ircII, Kiwi, rxirc, vms, rockers and msa ?" asked 
          the luser.<br>
          "In all of them and in the TPC, irchat, zenirc, zircon X11-irc and even 
          the<br>
          dos irc has the Tao" said the master quietly.<br>
          "Is the Tao in a telnet connection directly to the server ?"</p>
        <p>The master then was quiet for a long time and said. "Please leave, 
          such<br>
          questions are not within the Tao of IRC".</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The master says: "Without the Protocol of TCP the messages will not 
          travel.<br>
          Without the client, the server is useless."</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>There once was a luser who used the ircII client. "ircII can do anything 
          I<br>
          ever need for using IRC" said the emacs client user, "I have /ON's, 
          I have<br>
          assignments, I have aliasing. Why don't you use this instead of the 
          huge<br>
          emacs client, which also has a messy screen?"<br>
          The emacs client user then replied by saying that "it is better to have 
          a<br>
          scripting language that is the client instead of have a client that 
          has<br>
          a scripting language." Upon hearing this, the ircII client luser fell 
          silent.</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>The master Wumpus said: "Time for you to leave. I did, now I'm happy."<br>
          The master Gnarfer replied: "Use, but never overuse IRC, then you will 
          also<br>
          be happy within IRC"</p>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p>A luser came unto the masters of #EU-Opers and asked, "How can I be, 
          yet not<br>
          be, a user@host within the IRC?"<br>
          The masters of #EU-Opers replied: "To be Tao is to be ones true self. 
          To hide<br>
          ones self is not Tao, and is not IRC, you have much to learn before 
          you shall<br>
          be at rest within the Flow of Irc. Please leave"</p>
