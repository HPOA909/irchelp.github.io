        <p><b>Scilla! &quot;Wherever I Chat.&quot; 1997 (Approximately).</b></p>
        <p>By: Scilla!</p>
        <p>Apologies to A.A. Milne again! </p>
        <p>Wherever I chat there's always you, there's always you and me.<br>
          "What should I do?" I'd say to you. "Since I just got booted!"<br>
          "Well I did, too". It isn't much fun to loose your link!"<br>
          "But, that's how it is!" said you to me. "That's how it is!" said you. 
        </p>
        <p>"Let's look for Pet Chats" I said to you. "Yes let's" said you to me.<br>
          We searched the net and we found a few. "Yes these are Pet Chats alright" 
          said you.<br>
          We chatted for hours and then said "Poof". Silly old Pet Chats, you'd 
          like them, too!<br>
          "I always like Pet Chats with you" said you. "I'm never alone with you.".</p>
        <p>"What is your baud rate?" I said to you. "My what?" said you to me.<br>
          "I think that ought to be 2-8-8-0-0." "Well then no wonder that mine 
          is slow!"<br>
          "You bought a cheap modem, I told you so!" "But that's what I did" said 
          you to me.<br>
          "That's what I did" said you.</p>
        <p>So wherever I am there's always you, there's always you and me.<br>
          "What would I do?" I said to you. "If it wasn't for you?" and you said 
          "True!"<br>
          "Chat isn't much fun for one, but two can go together"<br>
          said you to me. "That's how it is!" said you. </p>
