        <p><b>[Author unknown] &quot;The Internet Explained.&quot; [Date unknown 
          - 1998?].</b></p>
        <p>Q. What, exactly, is the Internet?<br />
          A. The Internet is a worldwide network of university, government, business, 
          and private computer systems.</p>
        <p>Q. Who runs it?<br />
          A. A 13-year-old named Jason.</p>
        <p>Q. How can I get on the Internet?<br />
          A. The easiest way is to sign up with one of the popular commercial"on-line" 
          services, such as Prodigy, CompuServe, or America Online, which will 
          give you their program disks for free. Or, if you just leave your house 
          unlocked, they'll sneak in some night and install their programs on 
          your computer when you're sleeping. They really want your business.</p>
        <p>Q. What are the benefits of these services?<br />
          A. The major benefit is that they all have simple, "user-friendly" interfaces 
          that enable you-even if you have no previous computer experience-to 
          provide the on-line services with the information they need to automatically 
          put monthly charges on your credit card bill forever.</p>
        <p>Q. What if I die?<br />
          A. They don't care.</p>
        <p>Q. Can't I cancel my account?<br />
          A. Of course! You can cancel your account at anytime.</p>
        <p>Q. How?<br />
          A. Nobody has ever been able to find out. Some of us have been trying 
          for years to cancel our on-line service accounts, but no matter what 
          we do, the charges keep appearing on our bills. We're thinking of entering 
          the Federal Witness Protection Program.</p>
        <p>Q. What if I have children?<br />
          A. You'll want an anesthetic, because it really hurts.</p>
        <p>Q. No, I mean: What if my children also use my Internet account?<br />
          A. You should just sign your house and major internal organs over to 
          the on-line service right now.</p>
        <p>Q. Aside from running up charges, what else can I do once I'm connected 
          to an on-line service?<br />
          A. Millions of things! An incredible array of things! No end of things!</p>
        <p>Q. Like what?<br />
          A. You can ... ummmm ... OK! I have one! You can chat.</p>
        <p> Q. Chat?<br />
          A. Chat.</p>
        <p>Q. I can already chat. I chat with my friends.<br />
          A. Yes, but on the Internet, which connects millions of people all over 
          the entire globe, you can chat with total strangers, many of whom are 
          boring and stupid</p>
        <p>Q. Sounds great! How does it work?<br />
          A. Well, first you decide which type of area you wish to chat in. Some 
          areas are just for general chatting, and some are for specific interest 
          groups, such as Teens, Poets, Cat Lovers, Religious People, Gays, Gay 
          Teens Who Read Religious Poetry to Cats, and of course Guys Having Pointless 
          Arguments About Sports. At any given moment, an area can contain anywhere 
          from two to dozens of people, who use clever fake names such as "ByteMe2" 
          so nobody will know their real identities.</p>
        <p>Q. What are their real identities?<br />
          A. They represent an incredible range of people, people of all ages, 
          in all kinds of fascinating fields from scientists to singers, from 
          writers to wranglers, from actors to athletes - you could be talking 
          to almost anybody on the Internet!</p>
        <p>Q. Really?<br />
          A. No. You re almost always talking to losers and hormone-crazed 13-year-old 
          boys. But they pretend to be writers, wranglers, scientists, singers, 
          etc.</p>
        <p>Q. What do people talk about in chat areas?<br />
          A. Most chat-area discussions revolve around the fascinating topic of 
          who is entering and leaving the chat area. A secondary, but equally 
          fascinating, topic is where everybody lives. Also, for a change of pace, 
          every now and then the discussion is interrupted by a hormone-crazed 
          13-year-old boy wishing to talk dirty to women. To give you an idea 
          of how scintillating the repartee can be, here's a re-creation of a 
          typical chat area dialogue (do not read this scintillating repartee 
          while operating heavy machinery):</p>
        <ul>
          LilBrisket: Hi everybody<br />
          Wazootyman: Hi LilBrisket<br />
          Toadster: Hi Bris<br />
          Lungftook: Hi B<br />
          LilBrisket: What's going on?<br />
          Toadster: Not much<br />
          Lungftook: Pretty quiet<br />
          <p>(LONGISH PAUSE)</p>
          Wazootyman: Anybody here from Texas?<br />
          LilBrisket: No<br />
          Toadster: Nope<br />
          Lungftook: Sorry<br />
          <p>(LONGISH PAUSE)</p>
          UvulaBob: Hi everybody<br />
          Toadster: Hi UvulaBob<br />
          Lungftook: Hi Uvula<br />
          LilBrisket: Hi UB<br />
          Wazootyman: Hi U<br />
          UvulaBob: What's happening?<br />
          LilBrisket: Kinda slow<br />
          Toadster: Same old same old<br />
          Lungflook: Pretty quiet<br />
          Jason56243837: LilBrisket, take off your panties<br />
          LilBrisket: OK, but I'm a man<br />
          <p>(LONGISH PAUSE)</p>
          Wazootyman: UvulaBob, are you from Texas?<br />
          UvulaBob: No.<br />
          <p>(LONGISH PAUSE)</p>
          Lungftook: Well, gotta run.<br />
          Toadster.- 'bye, Lungflook<br />
          LilBrisket: Take 'er easy, Lungster<br />
          Wazootyman: See ya around, Lung<br />
          UvulaBob: So long, L<br />
          <p>(LONGISH PAUSE)</p>
          PolypMaster: Hi everybody<br />
          LilBrisket: Hey, PolypMaster<br />
          Toadster: Yo, Polyp<br />
          UvulaBob: Hi, P<br />
          PolypMaster: What's going on?<br />
          LilBrisket: Not much<br />
          Toadster: Pretty quiet<br />
          UvulaBob: Kinda slow ...<br />
        </ul>
        <p>And so it goes in the chat areas, hour after riveting hour, where the 
          ideas flow fast and furious, and at any moment you could learn some 
          fascinating nugget of global-network information, such as whether or 
          not PolypMaster comes from Texas.</p>
        <p>Q. I've heard that people sometimes use Internet chat areas to have 
          "cybersex." What exactly is that?<br />
          A. This is when two people send explicitly steamy messages to each other, 
          back and forth, back and forth, faster and faster, hotter and hotter, 
          faster and faster and hotter and harder and harder until OHHHH GODDDDDDDD 
          they suddenly find that they have a bad case of sticky keyboard, if 
          you get my drift.</p>
        <p>Q. That's disgusting!<br />
          A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. Could you give an example?<br />
          A. Certainly:</p>
        <ul>
          Born2Bone: I want you NOW<br />
          HunniBunni: I want YOU now<br />
          Born2Bone: I want to take off your clothes<br />
          HunniBunni: Yes! YES!<br />
          Born2Bone: I'm taking off your clothes<br />
          HunniBunni: OH YESSSS<br />
          <p>(LONGISH PAUSE)</p>
          HunniBunni: Is something wrong?<br />
          Born2Bone: I can't unhook your brassiere<br />
          HunniBunni: I'll do it<br />
          Born2Bone: Thanks. Oh my God! I'm touching your, umm, your...<br />
          HunniBunni: Copious bosoms?<br />
          Born2Bone: Yes! Your copious bosoms! I'm touching them!<br />
          HunniBunni: YES!<br />
          Born2Bone: Both of them!<br />
          HunniBunni: YESSS!!<br />
          Born2Bone: I'm taking off your panties!<br />
          HunniBunni: You already did.<br />
          Born2Bone: Oh, OK. You're naked! I'm touching your entire nakedness!<br />
          HunniBunni: YESSSSSS!!!<br />
          Wazootyman: Anybody here from Texas?<br />
          Born2Bone: No<br />
          HunniBunni: No<br />
          Born2Bone: I am becoming turgid in my manfulness!<br />
          HunniBunni: YES! YES YOU ARE!! YOU ARE A BULL! YOU ARE MY GREAT BIG 
          RAGING BULL STALLION!<br />
          Wazootyman: Hey, thanks<br />
          HunniBunni: Not you<br />
          Born2Bone: I AM A STALLION! I AM A RAGING, BULGING BULL STALLION, AND 
          I AM THRUSTING MY ... MY ... ummm ...<br />
          HunniBunni: Your love knockwurst?<br />
          Born2Bone: YES! I AM THRUSTING MY LOVE KNOCKWURST INTO YOUR ... YOUR...<br />
          HunniBunni: Promise you won't laugh?<br />
          Born2Bone: Yes<br />
          HunniBunni: My passion persimmon<br />
          Born2Bone: Ha ha!<br />
          HunniBunni: You promised!<br />
          Born2Bone: Sorry. OK, here goes: I AM THRUSTING MY MASSIVE KNOCKWURST 
          OF LOVE INTO YOUR PASSION PERSIMMON!<br />
          HunniBunni: YES! YES! YES!<br />
          Born2Bone: OHHH! IT FEELS SO GOOD!! I FEEL POWERFUL!!<br />
          HunniBunni: YOU ARE POWERFUL, BORN2BONE!! I FEEL YOUR POWER INSIDE ME!!!<br />
          Born2Bone: IT FEELS LIKE, LIKE ...<br />
          HunniBunni: Like what?<br />
          Born2Bone: IT FEELS JUST LIKE, OHMIGOD ... OHMIGOD ...<br />
          HunniBunni: TELL ME, BORN2BONE!! TELL WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!!<br />
          Born2Bone: OH LORD IT FEELS LIKE... IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I BREAK A TIE 
          VOTE IN THE SENATE!<br />
          HunniBunni: What did you say?<br />
          Born2Bone: Whoops<br />
          HunniBunni: It feels like when you break a tie vote in the Senate?<br />
          Born2Bone: Umm, listen, what I meant was ...<br />
          HunniBunni: This is you, isn't it, Al? ISN'T IT?? YOU JERK!!! YOU TOLD 
          ME YOU WERE ATTENDING A STATE FUNERAL THIS AFTERNOON!!!<br />
          Born2Bone: Tipper?<br />
          HunniBunni.- Whoops<br />
        </ul>
        <p>Q. Aside from chatting, what else can I do on the Internet?<br />
          A. You can join one of the thousands of forums wherein people, by posting 
          messages, discuss political topics of the day.</p>
        <p>Q. Like what?<br />
          A. Barry Manilow.</p>
        <p>Q. There's a forum for Barry Manilow?<br />
          A. There's a forum for everything.</p>
        <p>Q. What happens on these forums?<br />
          A. Well, on the Barry Manilow forum, for example, fans post messages 
          about how much they love Barry Manilow, and other fans respond by posting 
          messages about how much they love Barry Manilow, too. And then sometimes 
          the forum is invaded by people posting messages about how much they 
          hate Barry Manilow, which in turn leads to angry countermessages and 
          vicious name-calling that can go on for months.</p>
        <p>Q. Just like junior high school!<br />
          A. But even more pointless.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there forums about sex?<br />
          A. Zillions of them.</p>
        <p>Q. What do people talk about on those?<br />
          A. Barry Manilow.</p>
        <p>Q. No, really.<br />
          A. OK, they talk about sex, but it is not all titillating. Often you'll 
          find highly scientific discussions that expand the frontiers of human 
          understanding.</p>
        <p>Q. It is a beautiful thing, the Internet.<br />
          A. It is.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the "World Wide Web"?<br />
          A. The World Wide Web is the multimedia version of the Internet, where 
          you can get not only text but also pictures and sounds on a semi- infinite 
          range of topics. This information is stored on "Web pages," which are 
          maintained by companies, institutions, and individuals. Using special 
          software, you can navigate to these pages and read, look at, or listen 
          to all kinds 
          A. It's easy! Suppose you're interested in buying a boat from an Australian 
          company that has a Web page featuring pictures and specifications of 
          its various models. All you have to do is fire up your World Wide Web 
          software and type in the company's Web page address, which will probably 
          be an intuitive, easy-to-remember string of characters like this: 
		  http//:wwwfweemer-twirple.com/heppledork/sockitomesockitomefee##$.fle/fo/fum</p>
        <p>Q. What if I type one single character wrong?<br />
          A. You will launch U.S. nuclear missiles against Norway.</p>
        <p>Q. Ah.<br />
          A. But assuming you type in the correct address, you merely press Enter 
          , and there you are!</p>
        <p>Q. Where?<br />
          A. Sitting in front of your computer waiting for something to happen. 
          It could take weeks. Entire new continents can emerge from the ocean 
          in the time it takes for a Web page to show up on your screen. Contrary 
          to what you may have heard, the Internet does not operate at the speed 
          of light; it operates at the speed of the Department of Motor Vehicles.. 
          It might be quicker for you to just go over to Australia and look at 
          the boats in person.</p>
        <p>Q. Does that mean that the World Wide Web is useless?<br />
          A. Heck no! If you're willing to be patient, you'll find that you can 
          utilize the vast resources of the Web to waste time in ways that you 
          never before dreamed possible.</p>
        <p>For example?<br />
          A. For example, recently I was messing around with a "Web browser," 
          which is a kind of software that lets you search all of cyberspace - 
          millions of documents for references to a specific word or group of 
          words. You can find pretty much everything that anybody has ever written 
          on the Internet about that topic; it's an incredibly powerful research 
          tool.</p>
        <p>That is truly beautiful.<br />
          A. Yes. And it's just one teensy little piece, one infinitesimally tiny 
          fraction, of the gigantic, pulsating, mutating, multiplying mass of 
          stuff out there on the Internet. Sooner or later, everything is going 
          to be on there somewhere. You should be on there, too. Don't be afraid! 
          Be like the bold explorer Christopher Columbus, 
		  (E-mail address: ChrisCol@nina,pinta&santamaria.ahoy) 
          setting out into uncharted waters, fearful of what you might encounter, 
          but also mindful of the old inspirational maritime saying: "If you don't 
          leave the land, then you'll probably never have a chance to get scurvy 
          and develop anemia, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes."
        <p>So come on! join me and millions of others on this exciting CyberFrontier, 
          with its limitless possibilities for the enhancement of knowledge and 
          the betterment of the human race!</p>
        <p>Wazootyman is waiting for you.</p>
