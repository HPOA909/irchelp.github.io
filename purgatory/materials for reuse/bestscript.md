Selecting A Script

 

The most common response to the question ***"What's the Best Script?"***
is:

**"The one you write yourself!"**

> But that ignores the fact that many users do not script, don't want to
> learn, and ultimately use a script they have seen advertised, found at
> an website, or been given by a friend.

**Safe Scripts:**

**Kinds of Scripts:**

> **Purpose:** 
>
> There are thousands of scripts with different purposes.  Some people
> want lots of colorful popups .. others want to control channel
> behavior .. the next user wants to limit spam advertisements.  The
> "best" script is one that fits your needs.  You have to decide what
> those are.  What exactly do you want the script to do for you?  
>
> Full scripts handle lots of different functions, usually including
> flood attack protection, file transfers, marking you away when you are
> idle, and more.
>
> Addon scripts are more specific in purpose.  A single addon script
> will handle setting you away, another addon script will deal with
> floods or attacks.  There are thousands of addon scripts written for
> different purposes from fservers to memo handling. 
>
> **Format:**
>
> Scripts can be a single file, usually with an mrc file extension. 
> Normally that file can be written as a "Remote" script.  There are
> three script sections in mIRC: Remotes, Aliases, and Popups. Remotes
> work without you needing to interact via the keyboard or a mouse. 
> Aliases are for keyboard shortcuts and Popups are written for your
> mouse.  
>
> However, as mIRC scripting advanced, it became possible to add aliases
> and popups to a "remote" script.  This blurred the distinction between
> the three sections.  For more info on how the three sections work and
> are interrelated, read the current [mIRC
> FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20030810131720/http://www.mirc.com/faq.html)
> and the mIRC Help file that came with your copy of mIRC. 

**Signs of a Backdoor or Hacking in a Script:**

Script features to be very very careful of .. 

> 1\. Any scripts (usually found bundled as zip or rar files) that include
> an associated file that ends with the extension **.exe** or .**bat** 
> \[Ed. note - many other extensions are also dangerous, for more
> information read all about [trojan horse
> viruses.](/security/trojan.html) -Jolo\]
>
> 2\. Scripts that force you to join a particular channel or message a
> specific user
>
> 3\. Scripts that have /sockopen or any unexpected "Socket" components
> written into them. 
>
> 4\. Scripts that require you to use a .dll (dynamic link library) file
> that they provide.
>
> Also: Scripts that advertise themselves are, at best, rude and are
> more likely to have a backdoor.

Note that if you are looking for a "socket based script" it will
obviously have socket components in it.  The same for a dll based
script.    My best advice for new users is not to use these unless you
can personally evaluate the script in question or you have been around
IRC long enough to know someone you can trust that is expert enough to
do it for you. 

Popular scripts are sometimes converted into backdoors and offered to
new users.  The same for popular dll files.  You spend some time on IRC
and start seeing people use a particular script, finally you find it at
some website.  But the script you find may not be the one that was
originally written.  A malicious individual may have taken the original
script or dll and added a virus feature to it and then reposted it.  You
think you are getting the nice, safe original and the next thing you
know you have opened a door into your computer.  So be careful.
