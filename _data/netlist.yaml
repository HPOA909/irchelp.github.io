    They call it the best multiplayer game ever. Maybe they're right, maybe
    not. Anyway, here's a network full of (mainly European) addicts. It has
    grown from a subject-specific network into the largest IRC network in the
    world!

    Created in 1996 division of EFnet, IRCnet has continued to grow independently.
    Lays claim to historical privilege of being the original IRC network by virtue
    of still containing the core of early IRC, including the Finnish site where IRC
    was first used. Administration and operation are also more traditional than on
    other networks. Many of the most popular channels are “national” channels,
    devoted to the social gathering of people from Europe and Japan.

    Formerly the prime IRC network and for a long time synonymous with IRC. EFnet
    stands for Eris-Free net, due to a historical event involving a server with a
    machine name of ‘eris’. In 1996, many servers and users split off to form what
    is now IRCnet, since then both networks have grown and prospered independently.
    Both still do not support services such as channel or nickname registration,
    resulting in the most freedom as well as chaos for the users.
