### User modes for the major networks

It's been a long time since there was a single type of server used by all
servers. Since then, the various networks have all continued to develop their
own independently of the other. User modes are one of the things affected by
this all but the most standard (i, o and w) have the same function on all
networks. Each network has also added a set of modes unique to that particular
network. This also goes for smaller networks which usually base their ircds on
one of those used by the major networks but often diverge and add modes of
their own or change the behaviour of existing ones.

These user modes are supported by the latest server versions. Older versions
may be missing one or two modes or have a different implementation for some.
User modes which may be set only by IRC operators are marked with an asterisk.
Others will let themselves be set by all users but will return very little
information for a non-operator. Apologies to the folks whose browsers don't
support tables correctly - this was the only easy way of giving a comparative
overview. I hope to present an alternative when I have time to.

The list is based on the following versions which were the newest as of
September 1998:

EFnet: 2.8/hybrid-5.3

IRCnet: 2.10.0

DALnet: 4.6.7.DreamForge

Undernet: u2.10.04
