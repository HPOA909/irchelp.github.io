    Proposal for EFNet Channel Fixer
    William Rockwood, March 28, 2001
    Modified April 07, 2001 by William Rockwood
    
    PURPOSE:
    
    Prevent channels which lose ops from remaining in an oppless state.
    
    
    BACKGROUND:
    
    There have been a number of solutions proposed informally and even
    tried on the production EFnet network and each have and have had
    their own drawbacks. The common drawbacks among all of the ideas 
    involve human resources or the time of operators to actually intervene. 
    The reason for this resource drain is different in each case and more 
    extreme in two.
    
    The Hybrid 7 implementation of 'vchans' requires an operator to 
    create them, due to scaleability concerns if users were to create 
    thousands of the same vchan. This creates an unacceptable amount 
    of work for the operators and admins who have enough to do already 
    with day to day maintenance of their own server, their day jobs, 
    family life and what not.
    
    The EFNext (ircd-comstud-based) project implemented OJOIN and specified 
    a means of aggregating the channel ops in every channel on the network 
    which would be referenced by server operators when requested to assist 
    with an oppless channel. The administrative overhead of this would also 
    quickly become insane and is unreasonable.
    
    The patch for hybrid (infamously known as "OPME") was released, and run
    without a vote on several servers, and technically worked fine, but 
    completely overlooked many issues which are raised when restoring ops
    to a channel.  Essentially requiring a "leap of faith" on the part of
    the oper involved and left no room for accountability should the decision
    made in the end have been the wrong one.
    
    Further, there is precedent which shows that operator assistance in any 
    of the above ways implies that we as a group of administrators and 
    operators sanction the content of any of the channels which opers
    "interfere" with. This becomes undesirable when opers are asked to "fix" a 
    channel such as #0daywarez or #sexpics (random examples) which 
    potentially encourage the trading of illegal material. While opers could 
    simply refuse to help these channels, a much simpler, cleaner, fairer 
    solution can be managed.
    
    This proposed "channelfix" solution presents a quick fix to the oppless 
    channel problem with a "services-like" server which does, on a constant 
    basis, what the efnext "snapshot" mechanism does--cull a list of 
    chanops, index it and build averages over periods of time. Rather than 
    require server operators to be concerned with it, however, channelfix 
    operates on the client layer with a "fixerbot" client which it uses to 
    restore ops to channels which have become oppless. There are further
    potential uses for the channelfix server which are outside the scope
    of this document but include "repairing" TS0 channels, DCC functionality
    so admins and selected operators could "log in" to the service to watch
    chanfix's activities in realtime.
    
    
    FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW:
    
    The channelfix server operates as a "services-like" server in that it
    links to the network but does not carry clients, or even have the
    ability to carry clients.  It merely grabs the 8-10meg burst every
    10-30 minutes, distills it to useful information and stores it in
    a database to be held for 3-10 days as a historical datagram of
    information which it will then self-reference when it detects that
    a channel has lost ops.  Once fully functional, channelfix will
    join its "chanfix" client to the affected channel, compare the
    members of the channel to its stored list of people who have been
    opped in that channel and op the 5-most-frequent nicks (by userhost)
    and leave the channel, leaving it once again in a state of having
    ops.
    
    Here's a mock-up of what might happen:
    
    Pub: #fixtest   stranged log @wjr 
    *** #fixtest : End of /NAMES list.
    *** Mode change "-o wjr" on channel #fixtest by wjr
    *** chanfix (bot@chanfix.efnet) has joined channel #fixtest
    *** Mode change "+o chanfix" on channel #fixtest by chanfix.efnet
    *** Mode change "+oo wjr stranged" on channel #fixtest by chanfix.efnet
    *** chanfix (bot@chanfix.efnet) has left channel #fixtest
    Pub: #fixtest   @stranged log @wjr
    *** #fixtest : End of /NAMES list.
    #fixtest        stranged  G@  ~wjr@armitage.concentric.net (0 *Unknown*)
    #fixtest        log       H*  ~wjr@not.real.concentric.net (4 *Unknown*)
    #fixtest        wjr       H@  ~wjr@armitage.concentric.net (0 *Unknown*)
    
    
    As you can see, when wjr deopped himself, chanfix immediately saw it and
    remedied the situation. Since this channel was newly-created and wjr was
    the only one to ever have ops in the channel, log's userhost was not
    included in the op snapshot and thus log was not opped.
    
    
    TERMS AND LIMITATIONS:
    
    1) The channelfix server will not be able to be used to restore
    ops to channels until it has been linked long enough to get enough 
    samples to build averages. 3-5 days will be required for this.
    
    2) The channelfix server will not operate when less than 7/8 of
    the "full network" is linked--in other words, if 6 servers are split,
    and oppless channels exist on the part of the net that the channelfix
    server is connected to, it will do nothing, until the servers rejoin.
    This is to avoid excessive "fixing" during periods of instability. It
    will also not update its "snapshot" database during such times.
    
    3) The channelfix server will log all channels it fixes and who it
    opped.  This information will be available (updated nightly) on a 
    password-protected ssl webserver and made available to all admins.
    
    4) The channelfix server will only track channels with 8 or more
    users in it on a "full net."  Channels with 7 or less users will
    need to coordinate the re-creation of said channels on their own.
    This will cut down on the database size and the amount of "re-ops"
    performed by channelfix tremendously.
    
    5) The channelfix server will only track non-dynamic, idented 
    userhosts. A list of dynamic 'keywords' will be used to "weed out" 
    hosts to ignore.  This prevents Joe Dialup User from stealing 
    John Dialup User's identity in order to take over a channel.
    
    6) The channelfix server will have C/N lines to all hub servers
    with full H:.  This allows it to connect anywhere in the event
    of a network outage due to attacks or natural catastrophe.
    
    
    DETAILED FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION:
    
    Awaiting coder input. Non-detailed spec should be sufficient for
    admins to make a determination whether or not this system is 
    appropriate for use on EFnet or not.
