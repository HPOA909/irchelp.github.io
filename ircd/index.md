# IRC DAEMON -IRC Server Software

This page provides information and lets you download IRC server software,
commonly known as ircd (IRC daemon). It also contains information on how IRC
operators run these servers. Because these topics are extremely advanced, the
pages below assume that you are relatively experienced with IRC. This is not
intended for new IRC users.

**If you're not sure, please start with the [Server Request FAQ](server-request.html)**.

* * *

## Introduction

Start here if you're new to ircd, or want to learn more about IRC operators,
or are interested in linking to an established network.

**[Network / Server List](/irchelp/networks/)**      Looking for a list of IRC networks or servers? Here it is. **[Server Request FAQ](server-request.html)**      A must read if you want to become an IRC operator or link your server to a major network. **Guidelines for Linking New Servers to EFnet**      Only *after* reading the FAQ above, if you still want to link a server to EFnet, check out the semi-official guidelines for [Europe (east and west)](http://www.efnet.org/?module=docs&doc=18&type=html), [Canada](http://www.efnet.org/?module=docs&doc=21&type=html), and the [US (and also South America and other parts of the world not otherwise specified)](http://efnet.us/).

## Advanced Guides

Assuming you've read and understood everything above, you should have a decent
amount of IRC experience. Read on to learn more about the actual details of
the commands used by IRC operators to run IRC servers.

**[EFNet Frequently Asked Questions](efnetfaq.html)**      Originally covering the FAQs seen on #US-Opers regarding IRC servers, this guide has now been tailored more specifically to EFnet issues. Related to the previous two help files but written as a FAQ, which some may find easier to read. **[Myths of Opers](opermyth.html)**      Dispells the myths of what IRC opers can/will do to help you. Read this before you go running to an oper for help. **[IRC Operator's Guide](ircopguide.html)**      Introductory guide to being an IRC oper, covering the basic technical knowledge required. **[EFnet Oper Guide](http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/docs/operguide.txt)** [ext. link]      While the previous guide is older and focuses on basic information and commands, this one is more up to date and for EFnet IRC operators only. It deals with problem solving, i.e., "what to do when...". This external link points to the ircd-hybrid site, because the guide is officially distributed as part of the ircd tarball.

## Setting up IRCd

If you're ready to actually download and set up your ircd, here are download
links and setup guides. Remember, you are expected to have moderate to
advanced skills in IRC and UNIX, this isn't supposed to be easy or
particularly self-explanatory.

**Download: IRC server software**

  * **[IRC Servers by Google Directory](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Internet/Servers/Chat/IRC/)** [ext. link] - list of links for downloading various major ircd's.
  * **[services, server bots, and server tools](http://ircd.botbay.net/)** [ext. link] - "open source" programs that work with TSora based ircd's (Hybrid, ircd-ratbox, csircd, and 2.8.21+CS).
  * **[Blackened Industries](ftp://ftp.blackened.com/pub/irc/ircservers/)** [ext. link] - previous/stable versions of EFnet ircd, not updated since 2001.

  * **[Boston University](ftp://cs-pub.bu.edu/pub/irc/servers/)** [ext. link] - originally the "official" archive, but _very_ out of date (not changed since mid '90s) and now of historical interest only.
**[Setting up Basic Hybrid7 Server](h7setup.html)**      An introductory guide for setting up a simple hybrid 7 IRC server, requires competence although perhaps not expertise in IRC and UNIX. **[IRCD help](http://www.alleged.com/faq/)**      Specific tips and examples for setting up a hybrid 6 IRC server, requires expertise in IRC and UNIX.

## Miscellaneous IRCd Help Files

These help files answer specific questions regarding the use of IRC servers,
and may not necessarily have anything to do with running IRC servers or the
world of IRC operators.

**[Chanfix: EFnet op-less channel fixing](chanfix.html)**      Introduction to the op-restoring service recently implemented on EFnet. **[Channel Timestamp (TS) Zero Problem](ts0.html)**      What does it mean when your channel's timestamp is reset to zero? How do you fix this problem before your channel gets taken over? **[Major Changes in Hybrid6](hybrid6.html)**      This new ircd for many EFnet servers has major changes which may affect your clients and scripts. **[Hybrid6 Opers Features/Commands](opers.txt)**      This file outlines the features that ircd-hybrid has for IRC Operators. **[Server Numeric Headers](numerics.html)**      Server numerics extracted from the current ircd's for four major networks. Essential for people who write clients or advanced scripts. **[Server Desynchronizations ("Desyncs")](desync.html)**      Information on server desyncs and how to fix them. **[Timestamp and Services](ircserv.html)**      Technical document on how servers use time stamps to tell who first created a channel or assumed a nickname, also covers other server patches.
