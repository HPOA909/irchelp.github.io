# ratbox ircd

[ircd-ratbox](http://www.ratbox.org/) originated as a fork of ircd-hybrid. Although designed with
EFNet in mind, it's heavily used on many other networks due to it's
performance and modularity.

ratbox easily scales to network sizes of 100000 or more, with 10000 or more
users carried on a single server.
