# Guidelines for opers helping with CHANFIX

This document is a guidline for general procedure on how to deal with various
problems brought to #Chanfix. There are suggestions for Opless channels and
Taken over channels.

These are the steps I have found to work well. I learned these procedures
through experience of helping on #chanfix using trial and error.

## 1. Opless Channels

**a.** remind the user to read the website especially the part on opless channels.

**b.** Check the channel status on chanfix.

**c.** If chanfix says there are ops and shows both high scoring ops opped and non opped it generally denotes a desync.

**d.** Manually join the channel to check if it is really opless and if it has enough users.

**e.** If there are no ops on your server have another oper or a nonop helper on #chanfix check from their server to see if they see ops.

**f.** If the results show a desync I ask for a manual fix.

**g.** In case of not enough users, usually joining the channel will trigger chanfix if the score is high enough for them to get a fix.

**h.** In case there are no registeted users in the channel inform the user that they need to get the regular scored ops into the channel and it will get an autofix.

  

## 2. Take Overs.

**a.** Check the score with chanfix. For a score that is too small just tell the user to their channel is to new. The channel should at least be 24 hours old. (we need to come to a definite accepted time limit or score on this. I have had suggestions of over 300. comments please )

**b.** if chanfix shows high scoring ops opped, check the channel manually to make sure that the correct ops are opped and that its not desync; (this has happened more than once)

**c.** Ask the user how the take over happened and have they dealt with the problem e.g manual ops. If the problem is a hacked bot there is no point in fixing the channel until the bot is fixed or removed. 

**d.** If the scores clearly show a take over, then check the scores of the person making the request.

**e.** If the user making the request has a high score, tell them to have at least 4 more ppl available to be opped once chanfix is run.

**f.** While the user is doing that, start looking for a live chanfix admin by looking to see who is chatting where.

(I use operwall as a last resort to find an admin)

**g.** Before asking for a fix instruct the user what to do once a fix is run so that the channel will remain fixed. Basically telling them to make sure 4 ppl are opped before they do anything else.

**h.** Once they are ready, ask for a fix.

**i.** When the user asking has no score tell them they need to get a scored op to come to #chanfix and ask for help. If the user controls the channel bots, have the user give the bots nicks so the scores can be checked. Make sure they have access to the bots to get ops then give them instructions on how to proceed once chanfix is run.

**j.** When the channel appears to be taken over and is +i it is usually a sign its taken over. I then follow the same procedure of checking the score of the user asking or deternining that the person requesting the fix has a way of getting ops in the channel by finding a high scorring op or give me the nick of the bots .Then instructing the users how to proceed.

**k.** In case there are no scored ops available it is pointless to run a fix until the ops are live and explain this to the user.

  
Well this is the method that I use and I welcome any ideas or suggestions to
better this guideline. I also need some opinions if we should have a list of
admins availabe or just operwall

[Ed. Note - there are now so many chanfix admins (thanks to the 3 per server
rule) that one seldom needs to do more than an onotice in #chanfix, and
failing that, operwall.]
