    You don't need root access at all. Grab a copy of the irc server on
    cs-ftp.bu.edu : /irc/servers/irc2.8.21.tar.gz, compile it, create
    an ircd.conf file according to the explanations in the doc/INSTALL
    file, and execute the ircd program.


    If you only want people from your domain connecting, say, *.vu.nl,
    you'll want lines such as I:*.vu.nl::*.vu.nl::1 in your ircd.conf
    file.

    Good luck :)
